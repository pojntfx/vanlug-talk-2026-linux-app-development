# VanLUG Talk 2026 on "Linux App Development on GNOME and KDE"

Resources for the VanLUG Talk "Linux App Development on GNOME and KDE" (https://luma.com/reg1cv4u)

## Overview

Violet and Felicitas will give an introduction and tutorial on how to write apps for modern Linux devices. Both mayor ecosystems (GNOME and KDE) will be covered. For GNOME, Felicitas will develop and example app from scratch, which introduces the audience to:

- The GNOME HIG and developer ecosystem (Adwaita)
- The GTK markup language (Blueprint)
- GTK application structure (GObject, signals, properties, methods etc.)
- Writing apps in different languages (JS, C, Go, Rust, Java, Python etc.)
- Writing reusable modules that work from any language with GIR
- IDE setup (VSCode, GNOME Builder)
- Build setup and distribution (Meson, Flatpak, Flathub)

Violet will then develop the same application using the KDE ecosystem, and in the process show the audience how to use:

- The KDE HIG and developer ecosystem (KDE Frameworks, Kirigami)
- The Qt markup language (QML) (this one we're not quite sure about)
- Qt application structure
- Writing apps in different languages (C++, Python etc.)
- IDE setup (Vim)
- Build setup and distribution (CMake, Flatpak, Flathub)

By the end of the talk, the audience will get a handout with links to the applications both of us wrote, as well as all the links to the things we've covered. Any developer in the audience will hopefully walk away with a working knowledge of how to write their own applications, while regular Linux users will get a deeper understanding of how the apps that they use on a daily basis work.
