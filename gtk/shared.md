# Shared/Common Parts of the Talk

- Interacting with the OS through XDG Portals (https://flatpak.github.io/xdg-desktop-portal/docs/api-reference.html)
  - Interfaces for the OS
  - Independent of the desktop environment, everyone (KDE, GNOME etc.) uses the same interface, but different implementations
  - Each desktop environment can optimize for their own use cases, e.g. on something like GNOME you'll get GTK dialogs and GNOME HIG-compliant design, on KDE the KDE HIG, on Sway you'll get very lightweight power-user portals etc.
  - Available interfaces
    - User Information
